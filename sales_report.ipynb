    "# Introduction\n",
    "Web crawling has become essential for search engines and AI applications. The integration of these technologies has been explored extensively [@smith2020web]. The growth of digital content has placed significant demands on the efficiency and accuracy of web crawlers and artificial intelligence (AI) models. In response, Content Lifecycle Management Standards (CLMS) are essential for establishing uniformity in the way data is formatted, structured, and exposed for automated tools like crawlers and AI training datasets. CLMS helps ensure that content is easy to access, interpret, and process, leading to more accurate information retrieval and AI model training. This document outlines the development of CLMS standards for exposing information to web crawlers and optimizing the formatting for AI data ingestion. @fig-ai-training focuses on the AI training workflow.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Web crawlers and AI models are tasked with retrieving and processing enormous amounts of data from the web. However, the efficiency of these processes often suffers from the lack of a consistent data format, making it difficult to retrieve and interpret information at scale. Properly structured and formatted content improves both crawling and training processes by ensuring that key information is readily identifiable and accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLMS provides a framework for standardizing the way data is created, stored, and exposed across different platforms. By adhering to CLMS, organizations can improve the quality and accessibility of their data for web crawlers and AI systems alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI and Web Crawlers\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between AI and web crawlers has led to new frontiers in both industries [@jones2019ai].\n",

    "## Motivation for CLMS Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary motivation for creating CLMS standards lies in the need for:\n",
    "- **Improved Crawling Efficiency**: Properly formatted content with metadata helps crawlers index relevant information faster and more accurately.\n",
    "- **Better AI Model Training**: Consistent content structure ensures that AI models are trained on high-quality, organized data.\n",
    "- **Data Accessibility**: Standardizing the structure of content ensures that information is universally accessible across platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects include:\n",
    "- Uniform metadata\n",
    "- Clearly defined content sections (e.g., titles, headings, subheadings)\n",
    "- Embedded structured data formats (e.g., JSON-LD, RDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Developing CLMS Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing CLMS standards requires collaboration between content creators, data engineers, and AI researchers. The process typically follows these stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Structuring\n",
    "Content structuring involves organizing data into recognizable, standard components, such as:\n",
    "- **Title**: Main identifier of the content.\n",
    "- **Metadata**: Information about the content, including authors, dates, keywords, and relevant classification.\n",
    "- **Headings and Subheadings**: Structured sections that break down the content into digestible parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Metadata Formatting:\n",
